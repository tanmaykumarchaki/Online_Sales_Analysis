SELECT
  'January' AS Month,
  ROUND(SUM(`Units Sold`) / 31, 2) AS avg_units_sold,
  ROUND(SUM(`Total Revenue`) / SUM(`Units Sold`), 2) AS avg_revenue,
  ROUND(SUM(`Total Revenue`), 2) AS total_revenue,
  ROUND(SUM(`Units Sold`), 2) AS total_units_sold,
  ROUND(SUM(`Total Revenue`) / SUM(`Units Sold`) * SUM(`Units Sold`), 2) AS total_revenue_check
FROM `online sales data`
WHERE `Date` BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'
